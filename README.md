# Risk-Assessment-Project
Botium Toys Risk Assessment and Management

In this project I was presented with a fictional company, Botium Toys, a small U.S. business that develops and sells toys. As a security professional, I was tasked with performing a security audit for the company. The National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF) was implemented, which guided the establishment of an audit scope and goals, the listing of assets currently managed by the IT department, and the completion of a risk assessment. The goal of the audit was to provide an overview of the risks and/or fines that the company might experience due to the current state of their security posture.

Below are two documents. One details the scope, goals and a risk assessment report for Botium Toys. The second document is a corresponding checklist I completed that assesses adherence to established controls and compliance standards.

This project enabled me to assess the security posture of an organization, evaluate and identify risk present, and provide recommendations to the IT manager that served to reduce risk exposure and strengthen the overall security of the company. Overall, this was a great hands-on opportunity to dive deeper into risk assessment and management, a crucial skill of a cybersecurity professional.
